# Teacher suite for tests
This suite contains tools for teacher to create tests for high-school students, mainly for Computer Science and IT subjects.
This suite creates quizzes and other kind of test, as for example tests for evaluating progamming competences. Each student will have a slighty different test, to avoid copying between students. This suite doesn't require internet connection. This suite promotes a non-linear evaluation of student, e.g. not a single sortable value but more values to better understand students performances.

This suite aims to resolve mainly two problems.
Problem 1: to fully evaluate student competences, a "task of reality" (Compito di realtà, in Italian) is a recomended way of assesment. Nevertheless, task of reality in Computer Science often needs a computer with an Internet connection, and avoid copying between students is an issue. An automatically generated test for each students may allieviate the problem.

Problem 2: most of test are evaluated in a single linear scale, eg. A-F, 0-10, etc. This evaluation doesn't reflect the real complexity of student situation. This suite will create a multi-axis, star profile for each student.

## Objectives
- support multiple choice questions and open answers questions with evaluation grid
- propose tips to create good multiple answers
- easy to print, to match the needs of the Italian school
- create a different test for each student of the class, according to the student needs
- support specific learning disabilities, removing questions according to student disability or extending the maximum time
- create a profile of the student with strengths and weaknesses, to help the teacher developing effective strategies both for students and for the whole class
- provide statistics both for single questions and students, with tips for the teacher to improve the future classwork

Not all the above feature are currently implemented, but work is in progress and continuously updated.
