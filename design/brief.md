This suite contains tools for teacher to create tests for high-school students, mainly for Computer Science and IT subjects.
This suite creates quizzes and other kind of test, as for example tests for evaluating progamming competences. Each student will have a slighty different test, to avoid copying between students. This suite doesn't require internet connection. This suite promotes a non-linear evaluation of student, e.g. not a single sortable value but more values to better understand students performances.

This suite aims to resolve mainly two problems.
Problem 1: to fully evaluate student competences, a "task of reality" (Compito di realtà, in Italian) is a recomended way of assesment. Nevertheless, task of reality in Computer Science often needs a computer with an Internet connection, and avoid copying between students is an issue. An automatically generated test for each students may allieviate the problem.

Problem 2: most of test are evaluated in a single linear scale, eg. A-F, 0-10, etc. This evaluation doesn't reflect the real complexity of student situation. This suite will create a multi-axis, star profile for each student.
